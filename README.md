## Purpose

A repository dedicated for anything related indirectly to the JavaScript programming language or direct JavaScript code, primarily for learning purposes.

Files are most likely are not related in the context of web development, as that is contained in my [web-development repository.](https://github.com/afshaalzubair/web-development)
